# Newsie challenge

## Overview
Newsie is a news feed app that beatifully lists all the latest and greatest stories about cats. However, its not finished! You'll have to finish it and get it ready so we can launch to our users and hopefully raise some cash and retire.

You can use any library/framework you want to finish newsie. You can also use any resource you want, the internet is your friend! Here'e what's already included:
* `gulp` task to serve and reload newsie on any change, just run `gulp`.
* `bower` all set up for you to use any client side dependency you need.
  * all things fetched with bower will be saved into `client/lib`.
* sparse `html` file with some basic content.
* simple stylesheet.
* a `js` file that creates a bot named Greg that runs checks and tells jokes in your console, open up your console and see!

## Potential Features
* display them in a vertical list
  * use any images that may be in a set of data
  * get as creative as you'd like
* build feature for sorting the news items by their meta data
* build feature for searching for and filtering out news items


## Nice to have (optional)
* make sure to prevent XSS attacks!
* build out feature to create a news item
  * validate form before creating
  * show validation errors to users if any

## Have-to's
* however you make a feed-item (li, directive, component, div), be sure to include the `feed-tem` class on it to help Greg help you
* be awesome

## Tips
* get as far as you can, don't worry if you didn't complete all of the objectives, just try your best.
* if you do not complete all objectives and have time, show us what you got! (animations, style, magic)
* use Greg, here's there to help you. Open up the console and he'll show you how he can help.
* if you get stuck, truly stuck, try to create a question that will yield an answer to get you unstuck, nothing general like, "I'm stuck on css", but more like, "I'm having a hard time trying to change margins only to the 5th item in the list"
